# Rocket Project - Pir-Hana

## Introduction
This is Pir-Hana. She's named after the racing team from Psygnosis and Studio Liverpool's series; WipEout.

* Total length 1145mm.
* Cardboard Hull, 53.8mm outer diameter, ~1.5mm wall thickness.
* Haack Series nosecone with a shape parameter of 0, 
* 29mm motor mount, currently designed for any cesaroni pro29 case, though best for G, H, and I class reloads.
* Small avionics stack, operating off of a TINY2040, using a DPS310 based board for altimeter, and a MPU-9250 9DoF IMU for recording motion, contained in nosecone in a 3d-printed bay. Currently delayed for a later iteration.
* 4 delta-style fins, plywood, laser-cut at 3mm thickness, rounded.
* Thrust ring, motor assembly, front and rear anchors, and retention ring all laser or hand cut.
* Hardpoint anchors, thrust ring and retainer ring, aluminium and custom fit.
* G, H & I grade motors explored, simulation data stored in .ork, large range of compatible options.
* Maximum simulated apogee of 1497m on I grade motors.
