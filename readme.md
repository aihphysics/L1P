# Rocket Project

## Introduction
Hello! You've found my (third) rocket project! This is the one that'll probably work!

* Total length 1058mm.
* Cardboard Hull, 53.8mm outer diameter, ~2mm wall thickness.
* Haack Series nosecone with a shape parameter of 0, 
* 29mm motor mount, currently designed for a 5 grain reload cesaroni pro29.
* Small avionics stack, operating off of a TINY2040, using a DPS310 based board for altimeter, and a MPU-9250 9DoF IMU for recording motion, contained in nosecone in a 3d-printed bay.
* 4 delta-style fins, plywood, laser-cut at 3mm thickness.
* Rocket baseplate, motor assembley, front and rear anchors, and retention ring all custom made, majority cut and lathedfrom aluminium.
* H & I grade motors explored, simulation data stored in .ork.
* Maximum simulated apogee of 1427m on H grade motors.
